For example, the Ghost level will let you walk around Rod without him being able to see you. On the other hand, the Hard mode will see him sprint after you and hear every noise you make"

Of course, the sound effects also boost the tension and make your blood run cold. Yet, the music can be your ally as well. For instance, once the tempo changes and the music quickens, you should get up and run because you’ve been spotted! Then again, when the music dies down and all you hear is Rod’s mumbling, you can relax because you managed to escape"

      "So, the goal of the game is to avoid being eaten by the gruesome ice-cream man. Luckily, several methods can help you stay undetected. First of all, the icon on the right-hand side will allow you to duck and hide behind low objects. Also, you can ‘vanish’ by jumping into trash cans or dog houses. Either way, Rod will walk right past your spot. On top of that, try to make as little noise as possible"

      "Use The Map To Travel From One Location To The Other :\n\n As the title of the game implies, the ice-cream monster will torment the entire neighborhood, not just one home. So, your task will be to cover the area and look for clues in several different locations. Needless to say, going on foot would be a risky endeavor. Therefore, let’s steal the ice-cream truck and drive from one spot to the other. Less risky? Sure, it is. \n\n But before you unlock the option of traveling by van, you have to find a map of the neighborhood. As it happens, Rod will drop the map in front of your home. Once you pick it up and take it inside of the truck, you can then switch from one location to the other. Each of the spots hides different objects and clues, so make sure to explore the places as much as possible. The available locations are the Cafeteria, Parking Lot, Playground, and the Stall"
